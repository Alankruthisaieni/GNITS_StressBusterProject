  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Five Yoga Asanas For Stress Relief</h1>
  <div>
    Studies have found that even a little yoga, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. A fundamental principle of
    yoga is that your body and mind are one and connected. Practicing yoga will help you balance and tone the connection
    between your body and mind and build your ability to remain calm and relaxed.
    The practice of yoga will allow you to gently ease your mental and physical pace by focusing on mindful breathing,
    simple meditation, and physical postures. This will help to reduce stress, and at the same time, assist with lower
    blood pressure, increase lung capacity, improve your respiratory function, and heart rate.
    Yoga can boost your body’s production of hormones such as endorphins which are essential to cultivating happiness,
    health, and feelings of calmness. Endorphins, which are released when you do any form of exercise, play an important
    role in managing physical pain and negative emotions.
    Each Yoga pose has its unique benefits from improving your posture to relieving headaches and insomnia, while also
    restoring your nervous and lymphatic system.
