        <h2>1. Aromatherapy</h2>
        <p>Aromatherapy can help reduce pain and stress.Exposing your senses to strong smelling chemicals such as
          essential oils can positively affect your hormone production, brain chemistry, and stress levels.It is most
          effective when you involve your sense of touch and smell</p>
        <p>Using warm massage oils and/or essential oils in a warm bath are both powerful ways to use aromatherapy for
          stress relief.Heat allows the oils to soak into your skin and will loosen the blood flow and improve your
          circulation.Combination of both strong scented candles and oils is known to increase the effectiveness of
          anxiety reduction. Make sure to use scented candles/oils that are appealing to you and your senses. Popular
          scents are rose, mandarin, peppermint, clary sage, lemon balm, and lavender.</p>

        <h2>3.Box breathing</h2>
        <p>Intentional deep breathing can actually calm and regulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS).This system
          regulates involuntary body functions such as temperature. It can lower blood pressure and provide an almost
          immediate sense of calm.The slow holding of breath allows CO2 to build up in the blood which
          enhances the cardio-inhibitory response of the vagus nerve that produces a calm and relaxed feeling in the
          mind and body.It can also help treat insomnia by allowing you to calm your nervous system at night before
          bed.</p>
        <p>It can be done in a few steps.Sitting upright, slowly exhale through your mouth, getting all the
          oxygen out of your lungs. Focus on this intention and be conscious of what you’re doing.<b>Inhale</b> slowly
          and
          deeply through your nose to the count of four. In this step, count to four very slowly in your
          head.<b>Hold</b> your
          breath for another slow count of four.<b>Exhale</b> through your mouth for the same slow count of four,
          expelling the
          air from your lungs and abdomen.</p>

        <h2>4.Guided Imagery</h2>
        <p>Guided imagery is like taking a short vacation in your mind.It can involve imagining yourself being in your
          "happy place"—maybe picturing yourself sitting on a beach, listening to the waves, smelling the ocean, and
          feeling the warm sand underneath you.</p>
        <p>Simply close your eyes for a minute and walk yourself through a peaceful scene. Think about all the sensory
          experiences you'd engage in and allow yourself to feel as though you're really there. After a few minutes,
          open your eyes and return to the present moment. It can
          help you to relieve physical tension and psychological stress at the same time, distracting you from what may
          be stressing you, and getting you into a more positive frame of mind.“If we’re in a stressful situation, you
          know, just shifting our mind and focusing on a time when we were really, really relaxed” is an effective way
          to calm down, Brown says.</p>

        <h2>5.Walking with pet</h2>
        <p>Research has shown that walking promotes the release of brain chemicals called endorphins that stimulate
          relaxation and improve our mood. Walking does not have to be done at a fast pace to have stress-relieving
          benefits. Even a stroll at a comfortable pace promotes relaxation, studies indicate.Stroking and patting a pet
          can reduce the physiological indicators of stress, including high blood pressure.Benefits include improved
          cardiovascular fitness, lower blood pressure, stronger muscles and bones, and
          decreased stress.</p>
        <p>Pets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness, encourage
          exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Caring for an animal can help children
          grow up more secure and active.Pets also provide valuable companionship for older adults.A pet can add real
          joy and unconditional love to your life.</p>
