      <h1>Stress Relieving Foods</h1>
      <p>Good nutrition is an important stress management tool. Nutrition and stress are interlinked.Stress increases
        accumulation and
        storage of body fat, and can increase appetite, food intake, and body weight gain. Acute and chronic exposure to
        stress can alter both the quantity and quality of calories consumed, and stress-induced alterations in food
        intake and energy balance can interact with emotional state</p>
      <p>
        Eating a healthy
        diet can reduce the negative effects of stress on your body. You can handle stress better when you are as
        healthy
        as possible, so eating nutritiously is a good defense against stress.A balanced diet, with the right quantity of
        vitamins, minerals and rich in antioxidants can impact how we feel throughout the day, and if continued, even
        month and year.Sometimes, giving in to those high sugar cravings is all the secret we need to feel instant
        stress relief.</p>

      <h1>Music for relaxation</h1>
      <p>Music can have a profound effect on both the emotions and the body. Faster music can make you feel more alert
        and concentrate better. Upbeat music can make you feel more optimistic and positive about life. A slower tempo
        can quiet your mind and relax your muscles, making you feel soothed while releasing the stress of the day. Music
        is effective for relaxation and stress management.</p>
      <p>Indian stringed-instruments, drums, and flutes are very
        effective at relaxing the mind even when played moderately loud. Sounds of rain, thunder, and nature sounds may
        also be relaxing particularly when mixed with other music, such as light jazz, classical (the "largo" movement),
        and easy listening music. Since with music we are rarely told the beats per minute, how do you choose the
        relaxation music that is best for you? The answer partly rests with you: You must first like the music being
        played, and then it must relax you.You could start by simply exploring the music on this site. </p>

      <h1>Yoga for stress relief</h1>
      <p>Life can be stressful. For starters, there's your busy schedule â€” waking up super early for school, studying
        late at night for tests, juggling sports practice, homework, and meals. It's a lot to balance!There are many
        different ways to cope with stress. Talking with friends, exercising, and seeing a school counselor are just a
        few. Yoga can help reduce stress because it promotes relaxation, which is the natural opposite of stress. Yoga
        can benefit three aspects of ourselves that are often affected by stress: our body, mind, and breathing.</p>
      <p>Yoga poses are good exercise and can help loosen up the tense muscles in your body. The areas of the body that
        tend to carry the most stress are the neck, shoulders, and back. But other parts of the body (like the face,
        jaw, fingers, or wrists) also can benefit from simple yoga stretches. Yoga is so much more than just physical
        exercise, though. The key to getting the best out of each pose is to focus not only on your body, but also on
        your mind and breathing.</p>
